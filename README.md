# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Instead of using alerts, the result is displayed directly on the web page in a clean and user-friendly way. This version also includes **score tracking** for both the player and the computer!



## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser (`Rock Paper Scissors.html`)
2. Click on one of the emoji buttons:
   - 🪨 = Rock
   - 📄 = Paper
   - ✂️ = Scissors
3. The computer randomly selects a move.
4. The result and updated scores will appear below the buttons.
